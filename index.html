      <h2>Solar Powered Boat</h2>
      <p>
        As part of an independent study at Davidson College, I co-led a student initiative to design and prototype a solar-powered pontoon boat aimed at demonstrating clean, efficient marine transportation. 
        The project involved conducting technical and environmental feasibility analyses, optimizing solar array and powertrain configurations, and coordinating fabrication planning and materials sourcing. 
        I worked with sponsors and faculty mentors to secure resources, refine the design, and move the project from concept toward a functional solution.

      <h2>Aurelia Institute Internship</h2>
      <p>
        Worked on modular aerospace mechatronic systems, contributing to prototyping and experimental hardware development.
        Focused on materials optimization, modular deployment structures, and onboard control systems for dynamic stabilization.
        Worked with CAD, 3D printing, microcontrollers, and wireless controls to explore safe and reliable assembly methods in preparation for future deployment in microgravity.
